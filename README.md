# Regex Workshop: Part II
This is the second workshop of a two-part series for the pragmatic programming committee.
This workshop covers additional material such as grouping, flags, splitting/substituting text, and using other functions from the re module.

About the files
- exercise.py - The main exercise file that people will be working with
- taletwocities.txt - The same text file as Part I. However, will be using only for one method.

The solutions for the exercise file will be discussed during the presentation. If you are not able to make it to the presentation and/or want the solution file, please contact me.
